## Static Comp Challenge

This project was to create a website that has a lot of contrasting elements and accessability attributes. We had to copy a mockup website. This project was designed to gear us students to being more intuned with the accessability attributes in front end web developement. This project had been cleared by google WAVES.


- CSS
- HTML

## Theme

The theme here is Zelda. Only thing I took liberty on a few things from the comp, which were the colors, words, pictures, and hover effects.

## Wave

Everything on this site passes WAVE

## Known Issues

- Flexbox works like it should. Site is dynamic without mediaqueries, at the cost at not being so fluid.

- Box shadow on the cards need to be done in a more realistic manner.

- Could not figure out how to successfully separate the sass files.

- Too much margin on the right side of the cards.
