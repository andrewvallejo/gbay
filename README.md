This project was to copy a mock website that has a lot of contrast elements to gear us students towards being more intuned with the accessability attributes in front end web developement. This project had been cleared by google WAVES.

## Technologies

- CSS
- HTML

## Theme

The theme here is Zelda. Only thing I took liberty on a few things from the comp, which were the colors, words, pictures, and hover effects.

## Wave

Everything on this site passes WAVE

## Known Issues

- Flexbox works like it should. Site is dynamic without mediaqueries, at the cost at not being so fluid.

- Box shadow on the cards need to be done in a more realistic manner.

- Could not figure out how to successfully separate the sass files.

- Too much margin on the right side of the cards.
