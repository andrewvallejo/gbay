This project was to copy a mock website that has a lot of contrast elements to gear us students to being more intuned with the accessability attributes. This project was sent through google's WAVE and was cleared of any outstanding accessabilty issues.

## Theme

The theme here is Zelda. Only thing I took liberty on from the comp are the colors (Which are complemenary), the words, pictures, and effects.

## Wave

Everything on this site passes WAVE

## Known Issues

- Flexbox works like it should. Site is dynamic without mediaqueries, at the cost at not being so fluid.

- Box shadow on the cards need to be done in a more realistic manner

- Could not figure out how to successfully separate the sass files.
